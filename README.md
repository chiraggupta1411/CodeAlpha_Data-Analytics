⭐ GitHub README for All 4 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Tasks
📊 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship — Project Tasks

This repository contains all four tasks completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.
Each task demonstrates practical data analytics skills such as data extraction, cleaning, EDA, visualization, and NLP sentiment analysis.

🚀 Tasks Completed
✅ Task 1 — Web Scraping

Description:
In this task, web scraping techniques were used to extract structured data from a public website.
The process involved parsing HTML content, collecting relevant information, and transforming it into a usable dataset.

Key Highlights:

Dynamic HTML parsing

Data cleaning & formatting

Automated dataset creation

CSV-ready structured output

✅ Task 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Description:
Performed an in–depth Exploratory Data Analysis on the IPL Cricket Dataset.
The objective was to understand data structure, reveal trends, and uncover insights using statistical methods and visual interpretation.

Key Highlights:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Missing value analysis

Performance insights for teams & players

Trend analysis across seasons

Hypothesis testing (toss impact, innings comparison)

Correlation analysis & anomaly detection

✅ Task 3 — Data Visualization

Description:
Created a set of impactful visualizations to represent IPL data trends.
These visuals help understand team performance, season progression, player statistics, and match behavior in a more intuitive way.

Key Highlights:

Wins by team (bar chart)

Matches per season (line chart)

Toss decision distribution (pie chart)

Stadium popularity (venue frequency)

Top batsmen (if dataset supports)

Clean, aesthetically consistent charts

✅ Task 4 — Sentiment Analysis

Description:
Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
This task demonstrates how sentiment patterns can provide meaningful insights into user opinions and public perception.

Key Highlights:

Text cleaning and preprocessing

Tokenization & stop-word removal

Polarity scoring

Sentiment classification

Visualization of sentiment distribution

Insightful conclusions

🛠️ Technologies Used
